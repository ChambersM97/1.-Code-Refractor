Hello,

The first thing that I did was add an (id tag, "search-engine-optimization") on line 32. All of the images were missing
Alt attributes so I added those to the ends of lines 33,41,49,60,68,and 76. I also renamed the title to Horiseon and added a
Favicon to the tab bar as well. I changed the class="heros to id="Front_Page_Image". since it was only being used for
one element there is no need for it to be a class. I changed some of the div tags into semantic HTML, replacing tags 
with section, header, footer, and aside tags.
